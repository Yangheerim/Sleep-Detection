## Sleep Detection System with raspberry pi


### Motivation

`Graph of deaths in recent highway traffic accidents`

As you can see from the graph, the causes of accidents vary widely, but 70% of deaths are caused by drowsy driving. <br>
You can see how dangerous driving while drowsy is.

### Function

1. Eye close detection (ðŸ‘€Face, Eye detection & Eyes Closed?)
2. Notification for Driver (ðŸ”´Red LED & ðŸ”ŠSound) 
3. Notification for nearby car (ðŸŸ¡Yellow LED)
<br>

### Demo
If an eye close is detected for more than three seconds, it is judged to be drowsy and gives the driver a red LED and a warning tone.<br>
And informs the surrounding vehicles of danger with yellow LEDs.<br><br>

### Implementation

#### 1. Eye Close Detection
1. Using library(dlib/image_processing/frontal_face_detector.h>), detect face.
2. Detect left/right eye position.
3. Compute the avarage eye aspect ratio of left and right eye. If less than 0.2, the status is sleeping.

#### Labeling 
`White box+"Not Sleeping"` / `White box+"Sleeping"` / `Red box+"Sleeping"`

#### Compute the avarage eye aspect ratio  
`Aspect Ratio = (a + b) / (2.0 * c)` <br>

<br><br>

#### 2. Sleep Detection
1. Initialize time to 0.
2. If eye close detected and time value is 0, time = now;
3. If eye close detected and time value is not 0, compute total time with eyes closed (`(now-start)/CLOCKS_PER_SEC`). 
4. If total time with eyes closed  is over three seconds, sleep detected.

#### 3. Danger Notification
1. When start program, subscribe topic. (MQTT)
2. If publisher publish data(`Sleeping!`) with topic, broker publish to subscribers.
